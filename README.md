To play on a GUI, you can use any UCI GUI such as cute chess, pychess, nibbler,... and add the engine to the GUI program.

The engine can currently play rapid chess around ~3000-3200 ELO (subject to further testing). It beats Glaurung 2.2 with a score 5.5-0.5 in a 6-game match.

This uses NNUE evaluation. The handcrafted evaluation version is now at https://github.com/hoavu-cs/donbot_hce.
